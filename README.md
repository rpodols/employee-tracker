# Employee Tracker - Challenge 12

## Description
This project is the twelfth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

Starting from scratch, this challenge required writing code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
        -   WHEN I start the application
        -   THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

        -   WHEN I choose to view all departments
        -   THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

        -   WHEN I choose to view all roles
        -   THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

        -   WHEN I choose to view all employees
        -   THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

        -   WHEN I choose to add a department
        -   THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

        -   WHEN I choose to add a role
        -   THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

        -   WHEN I choose to add an employee
        -   THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

        -   WHEN I choose to update an employee role
        -   THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
